This project presents a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)-based machine learning model for classifying breast cancer subtypes using protein sequence data. By extracting Amino Acid Composition (AAC) features from FASTA files, the model accurately predicts five major subtypes: Luminal A, Luminal B, HER2-enriched, Triple-Negative, and Normal-like. Implemented in Python and executed in Google Colab with Google Drive integration, the pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and an interactive prediction interface for real-timeÂ analysis.
